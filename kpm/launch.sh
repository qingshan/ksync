# Invoked via `kpm launch ksync` (called from the scriptlet in
# /mnt/us/documents/ksync.sh). Opens the ksync WAF - a small Mesquite app
# for managing OPDS catalogs and starting/stopping syncs.
#
# The WAF is re-registered on every tap rather than just once at install
# time, because /var is tmpfs (wiped on every reboot) and kpm has no
# boot-time hook yet to redo this automatically. ksyncd writes status.json
# itself on start, so no status seeding is needed here.
